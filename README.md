# D&D Character Sheet Manager

> **This entire project — every single line of code — was written by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai) from start to finish. Zero handwritten code. 90% of refactoring decisions were identified and executed by Claude autonomously. The developer provided high-level review, set quality standards and requirements, and guided each step of the process, but the implementation is 100% AI-generated.**
